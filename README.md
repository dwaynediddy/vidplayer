trying to play a instagram embedded video without the instagram likes comments, etc

using video.js i was only able to load a video that was downloaded my attempts to add embedded instagram video where unsuccessful so far

adding the html embed from instagram directly worked although the original embedded code was widdled down to the least amount of code i could get it to while still working, 
unfortunatly all instagram features remained.

npm install - possibly neded to run locally if using video.js files

instagram video viewer is demonstrated at 
https://instagramembedvideo.netlify.app/

I found although you can delete the elements when inspecting the webpage you cant access an iframe element because it is not my domain

If you see my recent code the top is removed but only by a white div overlapping and buttons are still reachable, another solution would be downloading the video from instagram on a third party website and adding it with video.js as i have done earlier although this isnt very conventional and possibly unethical.
