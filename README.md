trying to play a instagram embedded video without the instagram likes comments, etc

using video.js i was only able to load a video that was downloaded my attempts to add embedded instagram video where unsuccessful so far

adding the html embed from instagram directly worked although the original embedded code was widdled down to the least amount of code i could get it to while still working, 
unfortunatly all instgram features remained.

npm install - possibly neded to run locally
